The aim of this project is identification of dynamical systems. Main target is to create robust algorithms for automatic calculation of transfer function coefficients for many classes of dynamic systems.
Genetic algorithms (evo_main.rb) based on "gga4r" ruby gem (by Sergio Espeja) is used for multiparameter functional optimization. SSF - transfer function and state-space library is also used to work with mathematical models.

Dependencies: narray and gnuplot ruby gems
Launch: 
"ruby1.9.1 /path/to/tau-ga/folder/main.rb" 
in the shell.
